You assume the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Services.
<br><br><b>Limitation of Liability<br></b>
BOUNX and the other BOUNX Parties will not be liable to you under any theory of liability—whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, warranty, or otherwise—for any indirect, consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages or lost profits, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable law, even if BOUNX or the other BOUNX Parties have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

<br><br><b>Dispute Resolution; Arbitration<br></b>
PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH BOUNX AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.
<br><br><b>Binding Arbitration<br></b>
Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation of Sections 10 or 12 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and BOUNX agree (a) to waive your and BOUNX’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms, our Services or the products and services available on our Services, resolved in a court, and (b) to waive your and BOUNX’s respective rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and BOUNX agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative Actions
You and BOUNX agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these Terms, our Services or the products and services available on our Services is personal to you and BOUNX and that such Dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding. You and BOUNX agree that there will be no class arbitration or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or group of individuals. Further, you and BOUNX agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or group of individuals.
<br><br><b>Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution<br></b>
You and BOUNX agree that each party will notify the other party in writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to BOUNX will be sent by certified mail or courier to [address]. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you use or used for your BOUNX account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent electronically and will include (x) our name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific relief that we are seeking. If you and BOUNX cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30) days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or BOUNX may, as appropriate and in accordance with this Section 19, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent specifically provided for in Section 19.1, file a claim in court.
<br><br><b>Process<br></b>
Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Sections 10 or 12 or Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and BOUNX agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or BOUNX within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose, otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and BOUNX will no longer have the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute). You and BOUNX agree that (a) any arbitration will occur subject to the laws of the state or country of dispute, (b) arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules based on the country of dispute. You may also litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
<br><br><b>Authority of Arbitrator<br></b>
As limited by the FAA and these Terms, the arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual.
<br><br><b>Severability<br></b>
If any term, clause or provision of this Section 19 is held invalid or unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and provisions of this Section 19 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 19.2 are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as prohibited by applicable law.
<br><br><b>Opt-Out Right<br></b>
You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 19 by writing to: engage@bounxsport.com. In order to be effective, the opt out notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 20.
<br><br><b>Applicable Law and Venue<br></b>
These Terms and your use of our Services will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the country the dispute is based in, without resort to its conflict of law provisions. To the extent the arbitration provision in Section 19 does not apply, you agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms will be filed only in the state and federal courts located in the country of dispute and you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consent and submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts over any suit, action or proceeding arising out of these Terms.
<br><br><b>Termination<br></b>
BOUNX reserves the right, without notice and in its sole discretion, to terminate your license to access and use our Services and to block or prevent your future access to and use of our Services.
<br><br><b>Changes to These Terms<br></b>
We may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If we make changes, we will post the amended Terms to our Services and update the “Last Updated” date above. We may also attempt to notify you by sending an email notification to the address associated with your account or providing notice through our Services. Unless we say otherwise in our notice, the amended Terms will be effective immediately and your continued access to and use of our Services after we provide notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop accessing and using our Services.
<br><br><b>Severability<br></b>
If any provision of these Terms will be deemed unlawful, void or unenforceable, then that provision will be deemed severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
